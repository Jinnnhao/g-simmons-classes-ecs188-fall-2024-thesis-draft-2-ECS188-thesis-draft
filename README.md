## Thesis Draft

The thesis draft should be **1/2 - 1 page**. It should be about 1 paragraph, 2 if you want. This draft is non-committal. You are welcome and encouraged to change your thesis as you develop your paper. It's often easier to make some progress when you have a tentative direction to work with, even when you know that direction is not quite perfect.

Your thesis draft should:
- Establish and motivate some issue related to technology ethics.
    - What issue are you taking a stance on?
    - Why should anybody care?
- Establish your stance
    - What perspective will you argue for in your paper?
- Give a preview of *how* you will argue your thesis.
    - What kinds of evidence will you use?
    - What subarguments will you consider?
